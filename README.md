## Description:
Mise en Place is a communal recipe tracker that allows you to share your favorite recipes with everyone. The name of this application is a reference to the common kitchen practice by the same name which is translated from french to mean "everything in it's place". It is the practice of oragnizing and preparing all of the ingredients and materials needed to prepare a recipe before starting or to fully prepare your station before starting service in a professional kitchen. With this meaning in mind, this application is designed to give you all of the information needed to prepare a recipe with the ability to make notes and to check off ingredients and steps as you work. Only the user that created a recipe may edit or delete said recipe, or make notes on said recipe to preserve a consistent log of improvement along the recipe's lifespan.
